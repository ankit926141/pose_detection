# Human Pose Estimation Project

- [Running Site](https://khushichoudhary1020.github.io/pose_detection/)


## Overview
This project aims to implement a human pose estimation system using deep learning techniques. Human pose estimation involves detecting key points on a person's body, such as joints and limbs, to understand their pose or position in an image or video.

## Features
- **Key Point Detection:** The system detects key points on human bodies, such as wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles.
- **Pose Estimation:** Using the detected key points, the system estimates the pose of the person in terms of body joints and limb orientations.
- **Real-time Processing:** The system is optimized for real-time performance, allowing for efficient processing of images and videos.
- **Multi-person Pose Estimation:** The system supports the detection and estimation of multiple people in the same image or video frame.
- **Customizable:** The architecture allows for easy customization and integration with other deep learning models or frameworks.
